# Vueling_Tech_Hack
## Dashboard-Data Science Challenge

‚úàÔ∏è Context:
At the last Annual General Assembly of IATA, the zero net CO‚ÇÇ emissions in 2050 (aviation sector) resolution finally got approved. That lets us be one step closer to the Paris Agreement of 2015, accomplishing not exceeding 1.5 ¬∫C the Earth's temperature.

ü¶æ About the challenge:
The information you will have is from the history of air routes. Datasets:

* **Date:** Flight date.
* **Origin_Country :** Country of origin.
* **Origin_Continent :** Continent of origin.
* **Destination_Country:** Country of destination. Target variable.
* **Destination_Continent:** Destination continent.
* **Total_flights:** Total number of flights.
* **Total_seats:** Total number of seats.
* **Total_ASKs:** (Available Seat Kilometer). Total seat numbers available by the total number of km these seats have flown.

**Archives:**

* train.csv (This dataset contains both predictor variables and the target variable). [Download 'train.csv'](https://github.com/datagseoane/Vueling_Hack/blob/main/data/train.csv)
* test.csv (This dataset contains both predictor variables and the target variable). [Download 'test.csv'](https://github.com/datagseoane/Vueling_Hack/blob/main/data/test.csv)

Carry out an exploratory analysis of the data that allows you to understand it better and find insights (ex: flights per month, most used routes, etc.) based on "Mapping Destination Countries".

The metric used to evaluate the predictive algorithm has been **F1 Score Macro**.
